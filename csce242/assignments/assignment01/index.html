        <h1>How To Create A Character</h1>
        <p>
            When creating a character, it is essential to focus first on
             what kind of character you want to create. Do you want someone who is brutish
             and blunt, or would you prefer someone calm and reserved? What kind of skills
             do you want your character to have? These are important questions when you're considering
             making a character.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's also essential to consider the statistics of a character.
            When playing role-playing games, stats are essential to overall
            gameplay-- these are also impacted by species and class! There are six statistics to consider in Dungeons & Dragons, specifically: Strength, Charisma,
            Constitution, Dexterity, Wisdom, & Intelligence. These are cornerstones for what abilities your character
            will have.
        </p>
        <h2>Reminder: What should you focus on?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Species & Class</li>
            <li>Statistics (aka Ability Scores)</li>
            <li>Character/Personality Traits</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Here is an example of some stats you may have put down:</h3>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Strength: 10</td>
                <td>Dexterity: 17</td>
                <td>Constitution: 11</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Charisma: 8</td>
                <td>Wisdom: 16</td>
                <td>Intelligence: 13</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h4>Based on these statistics, here are two classes that may work well for that character:</h4>
